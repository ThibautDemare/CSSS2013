## WHAT IS IT?

This is a netlogo model based on :

 Wilensky, U. (1997). NetLogo AIDS model. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/AIDS. Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. 

It is the sexually transmitted disease's spread inside a social network.

## HOW IT WORKS

The model uses "couples" to represent two people engaged in sexual relations.  Individuals are conected to each other by social link. If they are connected, there is a chance the two individuals will "couple" together.

The presence of the virus in the population is represented by the colors of individuals and links. Three colors are used: green individuals are uninfected, and red individuals are infected and their infection is known, blue links are sexual relation between the two individuals.

Some individuals use condom. According to the place they take in the network, they are more likely or not to spread the disease.

The sex-appeal of each individual give them more or less chance to be in a sexual relation.
